# SprigganRS
A "reactive" event-driven web game engine.

## Architecture
```
               .-> video
state -> view -|-> audio
  ^            |-> interactions -.
  |            '-> timers ------.|
   '-----------------------------'
```
All game state is stored in a JSON-serializable value called **state**.

This is then converted into a **scene graph** by a function called a **view** which is interpreted to produce video, audio and points of interaction.
